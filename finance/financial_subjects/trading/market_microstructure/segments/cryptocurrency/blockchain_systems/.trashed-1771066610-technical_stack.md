# TECHNICAL STACK

1. The Technical Layers (The Architecture) 
This model describes the functional components that make up a single blockchain network. 
Infrastructure (Hardware) Layer: The physical servers and computers (nodes) that power the network through a peer-to-peer (P2P) system.
Data Layer: The "ledger" itself. It contains the blocks of transactions, cryptographic hashes, and digital signatures.
Network (Propagation) Layer: Manages communication between nodes, ensuring transactions and new blocks are broadcasted across the globe.
Consensus Layer: The engine that verifies transactions and ensures all nodes agree on the ledger's state (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake).
Application Layer: The interface where smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) reside.
